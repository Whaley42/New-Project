# Spotify App
## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to have users connect their spotify account with the application to receieve monthly updates and recommendations. Each month the user will get an email of their top listened to songs, artists and genres. They will also have a monthly playlist created for them based on recommendations from the last month.

## Project Overview
The frontend consists of a very simple interface from app.py. Users connect to this flask app and login to their spotify account so the app is able to get
the tokens needed for user data. The app also sends an email of the users last months top songs, artists and genres along with a recommondation playlist to get instant 
results. Finally, they are put into the database so they can automatically get monthly updates.
